        <p>
            My name is Grace, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. I am also pursuing certificates in Artificial Intelligence and Engineering Project Management.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy building full-stack web applications, interactive visualizations, and applied ML/IoT projects. Recently, I’ve been focusing on React-based UI development, clean component design, and creating intuitive user experiences, while continuing to deepen my understanding of backend systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of school/work, I enjoy working out and cooking.
